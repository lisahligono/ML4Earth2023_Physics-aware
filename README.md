# Introduction
This repository is a part of our team's submission for the ML4Earth Physics-aware 2023 hackathon.

## Task Overview

In this hackathon, our goal was to develop a robust flood modeling framework capable of performing at large scales using input and ground truth data from the Pakistan flood in 2022. We focused on applying supervised machine learning methods, specifically utilizing the Linear Regression for Neural Networks model, to solve the 2-D shallow water equations. Our ultimate objective was to create a flood forecast model that can provide valuable insights and predictions in the event of future floods in Pakistan.

<h2>Study area</h2>
In the summer monsoon season of 2022, Pakistan experienced a devastating flood event. This flood event impacted approximately one-third of Pakistan's vast population, resulting in the displacement of around 32 million individuals and tragically causing the loss of 1,486 lives, including 530 children. The economic toll of this disaster has been estimated at exceeding $30 billion. The study area encompasses the regions in Pakistan most severely affected by the flood. The Indus River basin, a critical drainage system, plays a pivotal role in this study area's hydrology. (Adapted from https://github.com/zhu-xlab/ML4Earth-Hackathon-2023)

<h2>Methodology</h2>

Our solution is based on the Linear Regression for Neural Networks model, a powerful technique for regression tasks that combines the simplicity of linear regression with the flexibility of neural networks. Here's a brief overview of our approach:

1. **Data Preparation**: 

2. **Feature Engineering**: 

3. **Model Development**: We designed and trained our Linear Regression for Neural Networks model, fine-tuning it to achieve optimal performance.

4. **Validation**: 

5. **Flood Forecasting**: With our trained model, we can now provide flood forecasts based on real-time or historical data, aiding in disaster preparedness and response.
